### 🚘 **Accident Risk Prediction App**

A high–signal Streamlit application that estimates real-time road accident risk from environmental + roadway conditions.
It uses trained ML models to generate a mean risk score and 95% confidence interval, updating instantly as parameters change.

### 🚀 What makes this app interesting

### 🎛️ Interactive Controls: 
Adjust weather, road type, visibility, surface condition, and more through sliders and dropdowns.

### ⚡ Real-Time Inference: 
Predictions are recalculated in real-time upon input changes.

### 📊 Confidence Bands: 
Displays lower / upper prediction bounds at 95% CI along with the  mean estimate.

### 🌈 Risk Gauge Visualization: 
Color gradient indicator → Green → Yellow → Red based on predicted danger level.

### 🧠 Engineered Inputs: 
Includes domain feature transforms + derived predictors to improve signal strength.

### 💾 Pre-trained Models Included:
