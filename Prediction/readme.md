🚘 ##Accident Risk Prediction App

A high–signal Streamlit application that estimates real-time road accident risk from environmental + roadway conditions.
It uses trained ML models to generate a mean risk score and 95% confidence interval, updating instantly as parameters change.

🚀 ###What makes this app interesting

🎛️ ###Interactive Controls: Adjust weather, road type, visibility, surface condition, etc. through sliders + dropdowns.

⚡ Real-Time Inference: Predictions are recalculated live on input change.

📊 Confidence Bands: Displays lower / upper prediction bounds at 95% CI along with the  mean estimate.

🌈 Risk Gauge Visualization: Color gradient indicator → Green → Yellow → Red based on predicted danger level.

🧠 Engineered Inputs: Includes domain feature transforms + derived predictors to improve signal strength.
